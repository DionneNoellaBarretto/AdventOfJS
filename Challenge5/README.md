# Brief

In this project, we're going to check multiple checkboxes at one time.

You can use as many (or as few) tools, libraries, and frameworks as you'd like. If you're trying to learn something new, this would be a great way to push yourself.

# Getting Started

1. To get started, download the zip file. This includes all the project assets you need to get started: HTML, CSS, images, and fonts.
2. Take a look around. Look at the project's Figma file. This is a great way to see how the pieces and parts should look within the browser.
3. Open the project's `README.md` file (that's this!). It has additional information on how the project is structured.
4. Customize your project/file architecture to your liking.
5. Happy coding!
6. Once you're finished, share your work using **#adventofjs**

# Taking your Project to the Next Level

- Use a framework like [React](https://reactjs.org/), [Vue](https://vuejs.org/), or [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/). Or, if you're feeling particularly adventurous, try writing everything in Vanilla JavaScript.
- Add an additional checkbox to the top of the list, with the ability to check or uncheck all items at once.
- Take a step back and try writing the HTML and CSS for this project yourself. Start with the provided Figma file. If you get stuck, you can always purchase the [Advent of CSS](http://adventofcss.com) solutions, where Amy explains how to build this.
