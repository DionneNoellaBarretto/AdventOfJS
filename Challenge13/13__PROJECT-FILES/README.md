# Brief

In this project, we're going to create a Custom Modal

![custom-modal--small.png](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/d21d2791-6723-4ede-a742-b9678d6f8e10/custom-modal--small.png)

You can use as many (or as few) tools, libraries, and frameworks as you'd like. If you're trying to learn something new, this would be a great way to push yourself.

# Users should be able to:

- Click on a point on the image, that triggers the modal
- Click on the x within the modal to close the modal

# Getting Started

1. To get started, [download the zip file](https://store.selfteach.me/products/home). This includes all the project assets you need to get started: HTML, CSS, images, and fonts.
2. Take a look around. Look at the project's Figma file. This is a great way to see how the pieces and parts should look within the browser.
3. Open the project's `README.md` file. It has additional information on how the project is structured.
4. Customize your project/file architecture to your liking.
5. Happy coding!
6. Once you're finished, share your work using **#adventofjs**

# Taking your Project to the Next Level

- Use a framework like [React](http://react.com), [Vue](https://vuejs.org/), or [Svelte](http://svelte.dev). Or, if you're feeling particularly adventurous, try writing everything in Vanilla JavaScript.
- Take a step back and try writing the HTML and CSS for this project yourself. Start with the provided Figma file. If you get stuck, consider purchasing the [Advent of CSS](http://adventofcss.com) solutions, where Amy explains exactly how to build this.
- Add additional points to the image with their own custom modals.
  - Put the content for each modal, within an array, inside app.js
- Animate the modal in and out
